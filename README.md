# Express prototyping tool

Prototyping tool built in [Express](http://expressjs.com/).

## Requirements

* [Node](http://nodejs.org/)
* [Npm](https://npmjs.org/) (which comes with node).
* [Grunt & Grunt-CLI](http://gruntjs.com/)

You may already have some of these. Try the following to see:

* for Node, try `node --version`
* for NPM, try `npm --version`
* for Grunt & Grunt-CLI, try `grunt --version` which should tell you the versions of both

## Getting started

### Node

Get the Node installer from [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/). This will also install NPM.

### Grunt


You can install the CLI using this command:

    npm install -g grunt-cli

### Everything else

Use this command to get everything else:

    npm install

## Running the app

Start grunt to run the app:

    grunt

The app recompiles app/assets/stylesheets/application.scss everytime changes are observed.
